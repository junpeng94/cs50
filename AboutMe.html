    <h1> Introduction </h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I am Jun Peng. I am a Geographer by training, a product manager by profession. I believe in the idea of #TechForGood and that's why I chose the
        unconventional path of building, managing and shipping tech products, albeit my lack of technical experience.
      </p>
      <p> Currently, I manage two EdTech products:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Learning Management System </li>
          <li> Adaptive Mandarin e-book platform </li>
        </ol>

      <p>  Here, I will briefly highlight subjects I've exposure to, projects that I
        have undertaken and skillsets I've honed over time.
      </p>

      <h2> What I've tried (and but did not interest me) </h2>
        <ol>
          <li> Cybersecurity </li>
          <li> C </li>
        </ol>
      <h2> Domains I have exposures in </h2>
        <ol>
          <li> Leading teams using Scrum method  </li>
          <li> Product Management </li>
          <li> Project Management </li>
          <li> Sales </li>
          <li> Stakeholder management </li>

        </ol>
